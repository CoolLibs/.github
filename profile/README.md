# Cool

Welcome to the [*Cool*][website] organization! ðŸ¥³

In here you will find:
- The core *Cool* framework and its extensions
- Small libraries that we built for *Cool* and that you can use in your own projects without including the whole *Cool* framework
- Forks of third-party libraries that we needed to tweak
- Projects that are built with *Cool* and that can serve as examples for you to get started
- The sources for our website

Don't hesitate to visit [our website][website] for more information!
