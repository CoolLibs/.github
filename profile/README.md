# Cool

Welcome to the [*Cool*](https://coollibs.github.io/home/) organization! ðŸ¥³

In here you will find:
- The core *Cool* framework and its extensions
- Small libraries that we built for *Cool* and that you can use in your own projects without including the whole *Cool* framework
- Forks of third-party libraries that we needed to tweak for our needs
- Projects that are built on top of *Cool* and that can serve as examples for you to get started
- The sources for our website which is available [here](https://coollibs.github.io/home/)
